2048 is a popular sliding tile puzzle game where tiles have to be moved around and combined on an 𝑚 × 𝑛 board, with 𝑚, 𝑛 ≥ 2. Each tile has an associated value, which is a positive natural number. The game starts with two tiles at random positions which either have the value 2 or 4. Every turn, the player selects a direction (left, right, up or down) in which all tiles of the board are shifted. All tiles are shifted as far as possible, leaving no gaps, as if the board was tilted and the tiles were sliding in the given direction. If two tiles with the same value collide in the process, they are merged to- gether to form a single tile that has the combined value of the merged tiles. After every turn, a new tile with the value 2 or 4 is placed on the board at a random un- occupied position. The goal of the game is to merge tiles until a 2048-tile is created. The game is lost, if there is no direction left which would move or merge tiles. This is the case if the board is full and there are no horizontally or vertically adjacent tiles with match- ing values. In all other cases, tiles can be moved to the free spaces or adjacent tiles can be merged together, thus freeing up a space.

The GUI can be started using the command ./run_gui.py. The game is then controlled using the arrow keys. The GUI communicates with the MIPs implementation.
